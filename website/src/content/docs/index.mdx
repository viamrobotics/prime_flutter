description: Getting started with Prime Flutter documentation.

Welcome to the Prime Flutter documentation. This site demonstrates the components available in the `prime_flutter` library.

## How it Works

This documentation site is built with [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) and embeds the live Flutter application using iframes.

### Running the Docs Locally

To run this documentation site:

```bash
cd docs
npm run dev
```

### Running the Flutter Embed

The interactive demos rely on a running instance of the Flutter web application.
The `npm run dev` command handles building the Flutter app automatically.

If you make changes to the Flutter code `example/lib` or `lib/`, you simply need to let the prebuild script run again (restart the dev server or run `npm run build:flutter`).

## Playground

The examples shown in this documentation are powered by a dedicated "Playground" Flutter app located in `docs/playground`.
